            <h2>Growing Up in Brooklyn</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a vibrant mix of Caribbean and West African cultures. As a Guinean-American, my childhood was shaped by a blend of traditions — weekends spent attending Quranic school and dance classes, and helping my dad at his clothing store. Growing up around family entrepreneurs taught me responsibility, perseverance, and the value of hard work from an early age. These experiences instilled in me a strong work ethic and a love for creativity, which continue to shape my academic pursuits, professional goals, and personal passions today.

    <h2>Lash Tech</h2>
     
    <p>
        My journey as a lash tech began during quarantine, when I would just practice on dolls out of boredom. 
        Growing up surrounded by family entrepreneurs, I had always been drawn to creativity and business. 
        Once I arrived at college, I started practicing on my roommate, and by the summer of 2024, I took a 
        professional lash course. In July 2024, I officially launched my business, and ever since, I have loved 
        owning and managing my own venture. Running my business has taught me discipline, customer service, 
        creativity, and the joy of helping people feel confident and beautiful.
