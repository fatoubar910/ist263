        <h2>Growing Up in Brooklyn</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a vibrant mix of Caribbean and West African cultures. As a Guinean-American, my childhood was shaped by a blend of traditions — weekends spent attending Quranic school and dance classes, and helping my dad at his clothing store. These experiences taught me responsibility, perseverance, and creativity.</p>

        <h2>Lash Tech</h2>
        <p>My journey as a lash tech began during quarantine when I would practice on dolls. By summer 2024, I took a professional course and officially launched my business. Running it has taught me discipline, creativity, and the joy of helping people feel confident.</p>

                <p>When I was younger, my father bought me a penny board, and I absolutely loved it. Over the years, I grew out of it, but this summer I picked it back up. Since then, I’ve been going to Prospect Park in the mornings to ride my skateboard. It’s incredibly freeing and reminds me of the joy of rediscovering something I love.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <p>Traveling has been a passion of mine from a young age. I’ve visited countries like Guinea, Belgium, France, and London (as pictured below), and each trip gives me a sense of freedom and the chance to immerse myself in different cultures. In the future, I hope to travel even more and eventually live in another country. I’m especially excited to be going abroad to London next semester!</p>

    <section>
        <h2>School & Social Life</h2>
        <p>I love my friends, and the community I’ve built here at Syracuse is truly amazing. I never expected to find people who understand me and push me to be better. I’ve found communities that reflect all parts of my identity, and I’m so grateful for that. My time here is a mix of going to class, attending org events, hanging out with friends, and completing fun random side quests. Below is a picture from our first-ever ski trip!</p>
