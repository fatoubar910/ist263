Hello, my name is Fatoumata Barry, and I’m a junior majoring in Information Management and Technology with a minor in Marketing. I’m passionate about pursuing a career in Risk and Compliance within the consulting industry. My skill set includes Data Analysis, IT Support, Problem Solving, Data Visualization, Social Media Management, and Content Creation. I am also proficient in tools such as Excel, Word, and Canva.
Outside of academics, I work as a lash technician and enjoy exploring new experiences. Recently, I picked up skateboarding, and I love trying new things, traveling, and discovering new places. In my downtime, I enjoy watching shows like Teen Wolf and The Vampire Diaries, as well as reading and watching romance stories.
